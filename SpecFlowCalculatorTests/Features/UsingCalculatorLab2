Client requirements:
`A group of system quality engineers wish to customize the command line calculator program
to perform quality metric calculations. The engineers need to calculate the defect density of a
system. Furthermore, they require a custom calculation for the new total number of Shipped
Source Instructions (SSI) in the second release of a system. The engineers also wish to be able
to use the Musa Logarithmic model to calculate failure intensity and the number of expected
failures, performing each of these using a single calculator command.`

# Epic Description
Allow System Quality Engineers to customize the CLI Calculator program to perform quality metric calculations such as calculating
the defect density of a system, the total number of Shipped Source Instructions, and the failure intensity/expected failure using the
Musa Logarithmic model.

# User Story Examples
As a System Quality Engineer,
I want to be able to customise the CLI Calculator program,
so that I can calculate various information about a system such as its defect density, SSI, and failure intensity/expected failure
with Musa Logarithmic model.

As a System Quality Engineer,
I want to be able to determine the total number of Shipped Source Instructions,
So that I can determine other information such as the defect density of the system.

As a System Quality Engineer,
I want to be able to calculate the defect density of a system,
So that I can assess the change of defect density over the each system release iteration.

As a System Quality Engineer,
I want to be able to incorporate the Musa Logarithmic Model,
So That I can calculate the failure intensity.

As a System Quality Engineer,
I want to be able to incorporate the Musa Logarithmic Model,
So That I can calculate the expected failure.
